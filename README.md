Detailed Description
--------------------

This project was created in order to understand the $UsnJrnl format and start evaluating the forensic usefulness of the data contained within. Initial tests, particularly when viewed in conjunction with file system records, brought forward at least one interesting aspect of this data. File rename records are contained within the $UsnJrnl. When conducting an exam, this information could potentially be *very* useful in tracking the source/changes to files over time. Can't figure out where <badfile.xyz> came from? What if it was downloaded using an application, but later renamed? It may not be immediately obvious this is what happened. Since MFT entry and sequence values are contained in the journal, you should be able to accurately link files and their parent directories together.
